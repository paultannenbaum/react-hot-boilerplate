React-Tic-Tac-Toe
=====================

Implementation of Tic Tac Toe as an opportunity to learn Facebook's React

## Goals
In order to learn React (and eventually flux), I am going to be building the application in this order

1. Build a basic board where two players can take turns playing tic tac toe (learning basic react fundamentals, Owner/Ownee relationship, basic callback handling, etc.)
2. Build player history and other data displays to inform players of the current state (cross component communication)
3. Connecting game data to a data store (maybe local storage)
4. Retrieving data from the game data store
5. Re-implementing the application in Flux
6. Url routing
7. Specs and how to test the app

### Usage

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```

Now edit `scripts/App.js`.  
Your changes will appear without reloading the browser like in [this video](http://vimeo.com/100010922).
